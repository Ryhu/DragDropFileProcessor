# DragDropFileProcessor

This is a personal project to process files.
In this file processor, a file has: a type and a file number

First, it takes 2 things as input: a group of files and the file name for these files.
The GUI will then generate the list of file names that were drag-and-dropped. The list will also have a set of buttons naming the type of file.
The user will have to click on the button where the file type matches the file name.
Once the button is clicked, that list item will disappear and the next list items will move up the queue.
At the same time, a new file name will be generated based on the file number and type. That file, will be renamed and moved to a specific
destination.
